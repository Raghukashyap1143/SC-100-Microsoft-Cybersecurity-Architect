# Excercise-2: Data classification framework

You have been assigned the task of structuring data classification for Contoso Ltd. in preparation for an ISO-27001:2022 audit. The goal is to establish a robust framework that is crucial for ensuring effective data protection against leakage, deletion, and loss. Your role involves integrating a new project ID system for construction projects within the company. To comply with government regulations, all documents that contain a certain project-ID must be kept for 5 years.

You were given following examples to classify Project IDs:

|Project ID|
|----|
|PAR-1023-DA|
|BER-0822-AB|
|Rom-0419-bm|
|sTr*1223-Se|
|BaR#0418-ag|
|dui0522-in|

### Estimated Duration: 45 Minutes
## Architecture Diagram


 ![](../media/lab3/lab3ex2.png)

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:  

- **Custom Sensitive Information Type**: Defines tailored criteria for identifying and classifying sensitive data specific to organizational needs.  

- **Retention Label**: Establishes rules for managing the lifecycle of content, ensuring compliance with data retention policies.  

- **Automatic Retention Label Application**: Configures automation to apply retention labels to content based on predefined criteria, streamlining data governance processes.  

## Part 1: Design a solution

In this task you will design a concept to address the issues Contoso Ltd. is facing.

### Design Approach

This introduction of a new project ID necessitates the creation of a corresponding sensitive information type (SIT), which requires the development of a custom pattern incorporating a regular expression. Subsequently, this SIT can then be used to devise a retention label and an associated auto-labeling policy.

### Proposed Solution

|Requirement|Solution|Action plan|
|----|----|----|
|Identify documents containing project IDs|Microsoft Purview Information Protection|Create a custom sensitive information type|
|Comply with government regulation to retain data for 5 years| Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management|Deploy a retention policy|

## Part 2: Implement the solution

### Task 1: Create a custom sensitive information Type

You will create a custom sensitive information type to detect documents that contain project IDs.

1. Sign-in to the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal **`https://purview.microsoft.com/`** as per the credentials mentioned below:
    - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
    
1. You're taken to the new Microsoft Purview portal landing page. Select the box next to the statement, **I agree to the terms of data flow disclosure and Privacy Statements**, then select **Get started**.
1. From the left navigation panel, select **Solutions** then select **Information Protection**. Alternatively, from the main window you can select the **View all solutions** tile, then select the **Information Protection** tile listed under Data Security.

1. Expand **Classifiers** then select **Sensitive info types**.
1. From the **Sensitive info types** page, select **Create sensitive info Type**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-17.png)

1. On the **Name your sensitive info type** page enter following information:
    - Name: **`Project Identification Number`**
    - Description: **`Identifies project identification number`**
1. Select **Next**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-18.png)

1. On the **Define patterns for this sensitive info type** page, select **Create pattern**.
1. On the **New pattern** page, select **Add primary element** and then **Regular expression**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-19.png)

1. On the **Add a regular expression** page in the **ID** text box, type **`ProjectID`**.
1. In the text box **Regular expression** enter the following expression:

    **`[a-zA-Z]{3}(\W)?[\d]{4}(\W)?[a-zA-Z]{2}`**

    >[!NOTE] The provided regular expression is crafted to identify a sequence characterized by three letters, followed by potentially optional non-word characters, then four digits, followed once again by optional non-word characters, and ultimately ending with two letters. The presence of non-word characters is discretionary, and the overarching pattern is intended to correspond to a specific format or structure within the data.

1. Under the Regular expression text box, select **String match** then select **Done**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-20.png)

1. On the **New pattern** window, for the **Confidence level**, select **High confidence**, select **Create**, then select **Next**.    
1. On the **Choose the recommended confidence level to show in compliance policies** page, leave the setting to **High confidence level**, then select **Next**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-21.png)

1. On the **Review settings and finish**, verify the settings, select **Create**, then when the policy is created select **Done**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-22.png)

You have successfully created a new sensitive information type to identify project IDs.

### Task 2: Create a retention label

You will create a retention label to retain all documents related to construction projects for 5 years.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Solutions** then select **Data Lifecycle Management**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-23.png)

1. Select **Retention Labels**.
1. On the **Labels** page, select **Create a label**.

    ![altext](../media/lab3/image-24.png)
