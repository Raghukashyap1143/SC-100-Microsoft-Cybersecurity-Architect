# Secure Infrastructure

Contoso Ltd. recently acquired Tailwind Traders, which still uses local file servers for storage. As the cybersecurity architect of Contoso Ltd., you want to evaluate a solution to secure these file servers with your existing cloud environment. Tailwind Traders provided you with a test server (The Lab VM 2) that you can use for the implementation of your POC. In this exercise, you will set up the server and integrate it into your cloud infrastructure and security environment using Azure Arc and send server logs to Defender for Cloud.

## Explanation of Components

  The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:  

   - **Defender for Cloud**: A comprehensive security solution that provides advanced threat protection and unified security management across hybrid cloud environments.  

   - **Azure Arc for On-Premises Servers**: Enables seamless integration of on-premises servers into Azure for centralized management and monitoring.  

   - **Server Logs and Defender Integration**: Collects logs from connected servers and integrates them with Defender for Cloud to monitor security events and detect threats.  

   - **Regulatory Compliance Standard**: Helps organizations align with industry compliance requirements by assessing and monitoring adherence to regulatory standards.  

## Part 1: Design a solution

In this task you´ll design a concept to secure on premise environment inside your cloud infrastructure.

### Design approach

The initial step involves analyzing the requirements based on the described scenario, understanding the objectives and defining the requirements.

Based on the provided use-case, the following requirements can be outlined:

- Enable Defender for Cloud on your subscription
- On premises servers need to be secured
- Logs should be stored, that Contoso´s SIEM Solution can process them
- Assess the compliance state of deploy resources

In the second step examine Contoso Ltd.'s existing environment. Defender for Cloud provides recommendations to secure cloud and on-premises resources by identifying steps to improve configuration and deployment. By actively monitoring workloads, it enhances overall security posture and reduces exposure to threats.

### Proposed solution

|Requirement|Solution|Action plan|
|----|----|----|
|Enable Defender for Cloud on your subscription| Defender for Cloud | Activate Defender plans in Defender for Cloud |
|On premises servers need to be secured | Azure Arc | Onboard the on premise Server to the cloud enviroment |
|Logs need to be stored, that Contoso´s SIEM Solution can process them |Defender for Cloud, DataCollectionRules, AzureMonitoring Agent, Log Analytics workspace | Create a Data Collection Rule to gather logs from Contoso´s on premise Server |
|Assess the compliance state of deploy resources | Defender for Cloud Security policies| Enable the NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 Compliance and assesses your compliance state.|

   ![](../media/lab01/55.png)
1. Go back to Defender for Cloud and select **Regulatory compliance** (1) under Cloud Security.

   ![](../media/lab01/56.png)


Due to limitation off the lab environment, you are not able to see the resources as well as the compliance recommendations. It takes a while until the deployed resources are visible in Defender for Cloud.

In the Regulatory compliance dashboard you can now review any failing assessments that appear in the dashboard to understand the details of the recommendations.

By continuously assessing resources against these controls, Defender for Cloud identifies issues that may hinder achieving specific compliance certifications. Maintaining regulatory compliance is crucial for safeguarding your organization’s data and ensuring a secure cloud environment.
